# sokoban-solver
This is a sokoban solver which uses IDA* to solve puzzles with an optimal minimum solution length, as described here: http://www.sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Level_format#Level_collection

Download XSokoban test suite from https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/xsokoban/download.html (maps included with binary as screen.*), then place them in the `/puzzles/` directory. Alternatively, one can choose a mapset from http://sokobano.de/de/levels.php to test.
